title: 003 of 100, operators and conditions
---

third day, still on the path

this episode of tutorial was pretty easy, i can say that swift and c# has a lot of in common when it comes to the operators and conditions. but there is a difference when you want to compare object, in c# you will use `==/!=` and in swift you will use `===/!==` (i hope i did not mistake anything :D)

in this tutorial from hackingwithswit there are really summarized information about topic of the lesson so some of the knowlegde i have to refill from ebook 'swift programming - the big nerd ranch guide' from matthew mathias and john gallagher.

see you tommorow, in the next lesson.

and every time when i see a condition written in swift i can see this meme :D
