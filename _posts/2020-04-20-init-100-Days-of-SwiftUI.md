hello.

> a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step

i do not know who exactly said that but it is true gold. i often struggled with taking this first, single step. these days people are programmed to progress fast. it is not exactly bad but for me it started to be overwhelming. it often made me that i was canceling this whole learning process. today i am starting [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui). this blog was created to keep me on track and stay motivated. i want to post everyday what i have learned. that is all. keep your fingers crossed and wish me luck.
