i am glad that i still stick to my plan :D

first lesson passed.
i have see a lot of simmilarities between swift and c# syntax. that is good because it will be easier to code.
in my opinion c# saves little bit more keystrokes on variable with type defined:

{% highlight csharp %}
// c#
String superString = "super string";
{% endhighlight %}

vs

{% highlight swift %}
// swift
var superString : String = "super string"
{% endhighlight %}

i really like the 'spacer' when you declare the long, integer values:

{% highlight swift %}
// swift
var superInt : Int = 1_000_000
{% endhighlight %}

see you in the next lesson.
